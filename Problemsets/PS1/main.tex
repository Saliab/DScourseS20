\section{Why Data Science}
Nowadays, having a set of skills in order to deal with big data set is crucial in almost every field.  Organizing the data and removing redundant data and addressing missing values makes it easier to analyze and draw insights or conclusion from data. I believe acquiring necessary skills in this regard is going to be beneficial in my research and opens up more opportunities in my future career. I have been interested in taking data science courses offered by data science department but I decided to wait for this course and learn the fundamentals and build up a set of required skills, then pursue further and deepening my knowledge in this field. \\
I have no idea about what I'm going to do for the project for this class. Currently, I am working on two papers with Dr.Demir and Dr.kim it would be great to apply what I learn in this class on these papers. What I am doing with Dr.kim needs machine learning skills, since it is theoretical paper I would prefer to use this opportunity to come up with a new idea work on empirical paper and apply what I learned in this class.\\
By taking this class I would like to learn how to deal with big data sets and be able to work with different programming languages to keep up with technology and be able to move forward.
