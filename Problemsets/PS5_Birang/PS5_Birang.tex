\textbf{Question 3}\\
What about it interests you? Will it be useful to you at some point in the future? Did you use any online tutorials to help you parse the data? If so, which ones?\\
I used Wikipedia to get data on country code, I need this for my research since I need to merge several data from different sources and the name of countries are different in different web pages therefore I need to use country code to be able to merge them. In order to do this I used the notes of class.\\

\noindent
\textbf{Question 4}\\
In another section of the same TeX file as referenced in the previous question, tell me about what you found in the data (if anything) that was interesting or useful to you. What packages did you use (if any)?\\
 There is upward trend and I use \\
library(fredr)\\
library(dplyr)\\
library(ggplot2)\\
library(purrr)\\
